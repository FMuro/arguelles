# arguelles

Arg√ºelles is a beamer theme that helps you create beautiful presentations. It aims for simplicity and readability by following best practices of graphic design, like the use of [high contrast](https://www.contrastrebellion.com). Its typography is based on the Alegreya typeface, one of the 53 Fonts of the Decade selected by the Association Typographique Internationale (2011).

The theme requires the packages [pgf/tikz](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pgf), [microtype](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/microtype), [fontawesome](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/fontawesome), [Alegreya/AlegreyaSans](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/alegreya), and [euler](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/euler) to be installed on your computer. These are included in most LaTeX distributions, such as [MiKTeX](https://ctan.org/pkg/miktex) and [TeXLive](https://ctan.org/pkg/texlive).

The files `demo.tex` and `demo.pdf` demonstrate the main features of the theme.
